I want to change the word `AND` that is in line 1155 and 1172 became the `OR`, then I do the following steps:

1) Move the cursor to the line 1155, put in the word `AND` and press `CTRL+D`, as shown below.

2) If I press `CTRL+D` again, then that will be selected is the word `AND` next in line 1158, as shown below.

3) Because I want to select the word `AND` in line 1172, then I move the cursor to line 1172, put in the word `AND`, the press `CTRL+D` again, as shown below.

4) Then type the word `OR`, so the word `AND` that is on the line in 1155 and 1172 will be changed to the word `OR`, as shown below.
